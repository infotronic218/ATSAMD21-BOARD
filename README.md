# ATSAMD21-BOARD  designed Within Kicad 6
The aim of this project is to design a simple development board for ARM Based MCU line of Microchip for quick use and experimentation of the MCU interfaces. Severals sensors and modules are connected to the MCU interfaces for quick code implementation and testing.
## Used main components in the design 
+ Microchip MCU  ATSAMD21G17D-A
+ UART/USB Transceiver for debugging
+ SW Debug interface over JLINK
+ Bluetooth module (DA14531MOD) over UART 
+ LORA Module (RFM95W) over SPI
+ LED Driver (IS31FL3737) over I2C
+ Lion Battery charger (MCP73831-2-OT)
+ FLASH Memory (16Mbits) Over SPI
+ Temperature and humidity sensor (SHT40) over I2C
+ Digital LED (IN-PI554FCH)
+ GPIO exposed pins
